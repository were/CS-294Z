## Week 1 Session 2: Driving effective agentic programming

- Recap: This is NOT a class of Vibe Coding!
- Then what is this class for?
  - Educate you to be a good AI driver

- How is it achieved?
  - AI is giving you a team of you for effective programming
  - "A team of you" means: AI is just as good as you are
  - But you can save the most bandwidth of communication


- Before: Each of the feature requst takes you a whole day to:
  - Implement (half time)
  - Test (half time when buggy, and zero when good)
  - Document (why do i even do this? i remember everything...)
  - Why? Save time to move on.

- Recap: The biggest pain of agentic programming is:
  - Human interaction （we look at this slightly later)
  - How to manage a large codebase effectively and reliably?
  - Maybe AI's code is buggy?
    - Test it! Test does not make it 100% good, but better than nothing
  - You did not write this, you did not even read this! How do you understand?
    - Documentation!


- Proposed Solution: SDD, DDD, and TDD
    - Spec/Standard-driven Development (SDD)
    - Doc-driven Development (DDD)
    - Test-driven Development (TDD)

- Spec is the charter of the development
    - Spec of the development flow enforces AI to follow the flow
    - AI follows the sepc of development to read the spec of feature request to make the plan
    - AI follows the spec to conduct the plan

- What is the standard of the development?
    - Coding standard
    - Documentation standard
    - Testing standard
    - Standard: Write documentation first, write tests second, and write code last

- We did not 

- Doc-driven:
    - Update the documentation first
    - Documntation is for further reference, for better understanding
    - Which saves the CoT of understanding the code

- Spec driven:
    - Spec is both the charter of the
