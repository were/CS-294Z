# Agentic Programming - A Compiler Case Study

This class is aimed at demonstrating the concept of agentic programming
through building a simple compiler example, compling Rust using C++ implementation.
The slides are located in `./slides`.
- The structure of each session is `wxdy` where w is the week and y is the session number.
  - For example, `w1d1` is the first session of the first week.
- All the generated slides are written in [Marp](https://marp.app/) format.
- Use the `./style/style.md` file as the template for the slides.
- DO NOT use `cd` to change the directories. USE RELATIVE PATHS INSTEAD!
